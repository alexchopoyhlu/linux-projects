# ðŸ”’ Disable Root Login Over SSH

## What Was Done

Modified the SSH daemon config to block direct root login.

## Why It Matters

Root access gives full control over a system. Allowing direct root login â€” especially over SSH â€” is dangerous. Disabling it forces users to log in with a regular account and use `sudo` for privileged actions, improving security and accountability.

## âš™Commands Used

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Changed
# PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
into
# PermitRootLogin no

sudo systemctl restart ssh
