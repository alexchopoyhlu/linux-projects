# ðŸ“œ Log Analysis Mini-Lab

This project documents a hands-on log analysis mini-lab using Ubuntu Linux. It simulates common suspicious activity like failed SSH login attempts and port scans, then analyzes log files to extract meaningful patterns and indicators of compromise.

Each file in this directory focuses on a specific task in the analysis process, explaining what was done, why it matters, and which commands were used.

## Topics Covered

1. [Inspecting auth.log for Failed SSH Logins](01-failed-ssh-logins.md)
2. [Analyzing syslog for Port Scanning Activity](02-port-scanning-detection.md)
3. [Summarizing Suspicious IP Addresses](03-ip-summarization.md)
4. [Using journalctl for SSH Log Analysis](04-journalctl-ssh.md)
